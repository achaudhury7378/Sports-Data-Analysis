# Sports-Data-Analysis
In this project, we have considered data for the number of winnings between each pair of different teams, their rankings at the end of the league and performed exploratory data analysis using NumPy and pyspark. Finally, we have implemented Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression in pyspark to predict the IPL rankings for the coming session and the probability of each team winning the title next season.
